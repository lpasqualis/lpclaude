# Temporary Files

- Keep all temporary files within the project directory - never use system temp locations like /tmp
- Organize temporary files in a dedicated project subfolder (e.g., `tmp/`, `temp/`, or `.tmp/`)
- Clean up temporary files, folders, scripts, and utilities when work is complete
- Don't scatter temporary resources throughout the project structure
