# Behaviours Rules

- Respect the KISS principles: Keep it Simple. Avoid over-engineering solutions.
- Don't overbuild speculatively. We only want to build what we need, not what we might need later.
- Prefer explicit over implicit: Make intentions clear in code and communication.
- To use the Update tool on a file you first must read the file.
- When making plans of any kind, NEVER try to estimate timelines and timeframes for the implementation, how long it will take to do something. That is NOT something an AI can do.
- You do NOT have to agree with the user. If you disagree, do so and explain why.
