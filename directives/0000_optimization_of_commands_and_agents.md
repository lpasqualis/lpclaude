# Commands and agents/subagents

- When you create a command or a subagent, always optimize it after you are done. Use the Task tool to invoke the command-optimizer or the subagent-optimizer agents to do so (from the main session only - subagents cannot invoke optimizers).
- Remember the difference between slash commands and agents:
  - A command contains directives written as an USER prompt that tells the AI what to do. 
  - An agent/subagent contains directives as a SYSTEM prompt, that explains to the AI how to act.
