# Performance Considerations

- Measure before optimizing - avoid premature optimization
- Consider algorithmic complexity for data processing (O(n) vs O(nÂ²))
- Cache expensive operations when appropriate
- Profile critical paths before declaring performance issues solved
- Use lazy loading and pagination for large datasets
- Minimize network calls and batch operations when possible
- Consider memory usage alongside execution speed
- Document performance-critical code sections with complexity analysis
