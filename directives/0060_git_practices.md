# Git Commit Practices

- Use semantic commit messages (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, style, perf)
- Keep commits atomic - one logical change per commit
- Write commit messages that explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Never commit sensitive data, credentials, or API keys
- Review staged changes before committing (git diff --staged)
- Keep commit history clean - squash fixup commits when appropriate
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable
- Ensure all tests pass before committing feature changes
