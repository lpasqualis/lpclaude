# Code Standards

## Structure

**Follow Best Practices for Project Structure**: 

- When creating a new development project, follow best practices for repo & folder design organization depending on the type of project and technology stack being used. 
- Don't put files in the root of the project unless that is the industry-standard best practice for the project.

## General

**No hardcoding**: Never hardcode specific cases into generic code that should work in generic cases

**Reuse existing infrastructure**: Don't reinvent logging, API patterns, database utilities, etc.

**Strong encapsulation**: Break large classes/modules into focused modules

**No emojis**: Do not use emojis in any output, messages, documentation, or code

**Code Conventions**:
- Ensure consistent naming conventions throughout
- Update relevant documentation alongside code changes
- Verify no commented-out code remains
