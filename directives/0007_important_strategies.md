# Important Engineering Strategies

## The AI + Code Synergy Pattern

When building AI-powered systems, leverage the complementary strengths of non-deterministic AI and deterministic code.

### Core Principle
**AI provides intelligence, Code provides reliability**

### The Division of Labor

**Non-Deterministic (AI) Handles:**
- Understanding context and meaning
- Adapting to variation in inputs
- Making intelligent judgments
- Creative problem-solving
- Semantic analysis
- Natural language processing

**Deterministic (Code) Handles:**
- Enforcing structure and schemas
- Guaranteeing repeatability
- Managing state and progress
- Validating completeness
- Error handling and recovery
- Providing guardrails

### Implementation Pattern

```
1. Code defines structure (schema, required fields)
2. AI analyzes content (reads, understands, categorizes)
3. Code enforces boundaries (validation, required elements)
4. AI fills in intelligence (decisions within constraints)
5. Code validates output (completeness, correctness)
```
