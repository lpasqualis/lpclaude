description: Create a comprehensive implementation plan from the current conversation context
argument-hint: "[existing implementation name] (if updating an existing one)"
allowed-tools: Write
---

Based on the current conversation context, create a comprehensive implementation plan for the discussed feature, fix, or project component. Save the plan in the project's `docs/implans/` directory. If the plan already exists, update it instead to fully comply with the instructions below (including file and location). Ensure the plan includes detailed steps, validation criteria, and expected outcomes.

## Instructions

1. Decide if the plan should be created or updated based on whether it already exists. The optional implementation plan name passed is "$ARGUMENTS"
2. **Analyze the conversation** to identify:
   - The feature/fix/component being discussed
   - Key requirements and constraints
   - Technical approach and architecture
   - Identified risks and challenges

3. **Create or update (if it is already present) the implementation plan** using the template below
4. **Name the file** appropriately: `docs/implans/ACTIVE_<DESCRIPTIVE-NAME>_implan.md`
   1. The file name will change to `completed_<YYYYY-MM-DD>-<descriptive-name>_implan.md` when the plan is finalized
   2. If the file already exists, change the name to comply with the naming convention above
5. **Fill in all sections** with relevant information from the conversation

## Implementation Plan Template

Use this exact template structure:

```markdown
# [Feature/Component Name] Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Author:** [Get from context or use "Team"]  
**Status:** üöß IN PROGRESS

## ü§ñ Agent Instructions

### For Agents Resuming Work

1. **Start Here**: Read the "Current Status" section to understand what has been completed
2. **Check TODOs**: Look for unchecked items in the implementation phases
3. **Update Status**: Mark items complete as you finish them using [x]
4. **Document Learnings**: Add important discoveries to the "Learnings & Decisions" section
5. **Test Your Work**: Run tests mentioned in each phase before marking complete.
6. **Update This Doc**: Keep this document current - it's the source of truth. If the work on phase affects other phases, update those too accordingly.
7. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity; focus on essential details.

#### VERY IMPORTANT
- **Done means that it is fully implemented and proven to work** You cannot mark items are done until they are fully implemented and tested and they are proven work as designed.
  - If a test coudn't be executed for any reason, the item is NOT done.
  - If the project has unit tests, any non-trivial item marked as done MUST include a passing unit test following the project standards.
  - If the project has manual or integration tests, any non-trivial item marked as done MUST have a corresponding passing manual or integration test included and following the project standards.
  - If there are no tests available yet, write down why and how you intend to add them later.
  - Work with the user to ensure that the test can run properly.
  - Warnings and errors are not acceptable. Items that generate warnings or errors cannot be marked as done.
  - If an item is incomplete due to external factors (e.g., waiting for another team), mark it as such but keep working towards completion if possible.
- **Living Document**: This implementation plan is a living document that MUST be kept updated throughout the implementation
- **Session Updates**: After each work session, update the session history and current status
- **Progress Tracking**: Use checkboxes [x] to track completed items
- **Percentage Updates**: Keep the overall progress percentage current
- **Agent Handoff**: This document is the primary handoff mechanism between agents
- **Get today's date from the date command**: Run "date" to get the current date. Do not assume what day it is.

## Important Notes

After creating the implementation plan:
1. Confirm the file was created successfully
2. Provide the file path
3. Give a brief summary of the plan's structure and current status
