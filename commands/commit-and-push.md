# Commit and Push

First, consider all files in the project that have changed, even if you didn't change them in the current session.
If you think there are files that should not be in version control, ask the user.
If the changed files are not logically grouped, decide how to bundle them into separate commits that are logically grouped. 
Add all modified and new files to git.  
Then commit in logcally related groups with clear and concise one-line commit messages, using semantic commit notation.
Then push the commit to origin.

Notes:
- Do not write in the commit messages that the checkin was authored by Cloud Code.
