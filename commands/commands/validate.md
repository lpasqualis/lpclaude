Validate an existing command against current best practices and suggest improvements.

## Command Location

Determine the command file path:
- If name starts with `/`, extract: `/namespace:command` â†’ `namespace/command.md`
- Search in `.claude/commands/` first, then `~/.claude/commands/`

## Validation Process

Use the existing validation task template:

```markdown
template = Read('workers/commands-validate-workers/command-validator.md')
command_content = Read('[command-file-path]')
Task(subagent_type: 'general-purpose', prompt: template + '\n\nCOMMAND TO VALIDATE:\n' + command_content)
```

- Proper placeholder usage
- Structural organization
- Context handling

### Best Practices Compliance

- Process vs practice misalignment
- Security vulnerabilities

## Output Format

Present validation results with:
- Compliant areas
- Issues found with specific recommendations
