# Capture Strategy Documentation

Create a comprehensive project strategy document that captures the current session context, ensuring seamless handoffs between agent sessions. This document will serve as the definitive reference for project continuity.

## Document Creation Requirements

**Storage Location:** Save the document in the main documents folder of the current project with a descriptive filename (e.g., `project-strategy-[date].md` or `[project-name]-implementation-plan.md`).

**Document Structure:** Your document must include the following sections:

### 1. Problem Statement
- Clearly articulate the problem being solved
- Define specific success criteria and measurable outcomes
- Include any constraints or requirements that must be considered

### 2. Strategy Overview
- Summarize the agreed-upon approach or methodology
- Highlight key architectural decisions or strategic choices
- Note any alternative approaches that were considered and why they were rejected

### 3. Phased Implementation Plan
Break down the implementation into logical phases. For each phase, provide:

- **Phase Name and Objective:** Clear statement of phase purpose
- **Tasks:** Specific, actionable tasks to complete
- **Intended Outcomes:** Measurable deliverables and results
- **Dependencies:** Prerequisites or blocking factors
- **Status Section:** Dedicated space for ongoing updates and notes

### 4. Document Usage Notes
**Include this section in the document itself** to explain:

- How to assess current implementation status
- How to review completed work from previous phases
- When and how to update documentation as work progresses
- The importance of maintaining context for future agent sessions
- Best practices for using this document as a project reference

### 5. Technical Notes
Capture implementation details that future agents need to know:

- How to run tests and validate changes
- Key architectural patterns or conventions being followed
- Important file locations and project structure details
- Any special setup requirements or environment considerations
- Links to relevant external resources or documentation

## Context Integration

If working with selected text or previous outputs, incorporate relevant details from {{selected_text}} and {{last_output}} into the appropriate sections of the strategy document.
