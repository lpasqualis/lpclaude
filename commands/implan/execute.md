Load and continue work on an implementation plan from the project's `docs/implans/` directory.

## Workflow

### 1. Find the Implementation Plan
- If an implementation name is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, look for a file matching that name
- If no argument provided:
  - Look for all `ACTIVE_*_implan.md` files in `docs/implans/`
  - If only one active plan exists, use it
  - If multiple active plans exist, list them and ask the user to select one
  - If no active plans exist, inform the user and suggest using `/implan:create`

### 2. Read and Analyze the Plan
Read the entire implementation plan document and pay special attention to:
- **ðŸ¤– Agent Instructions** section for guidance
- **ðŸ“Š Current Status** section to understand progress
- **ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps** section for immediate tasks
- Unchecked `[ ]` items in the implementation phases

### 3. Continue the Implementation
- Start with the immediate TODOs listed in "Notes for Next Session"
- Work on unchecked tasks in the current active phase
- Follow the validation criteria specified for each task
- Run tests as specified in the plan before marking items complete

### 4. Update the Plan as You Work
- Mark completed items with `[x]`
- Update the "Current Status" section with today's date
- Add session notes to the "Session History"
- Document any new learnings or decisions
- Update progress percentages
- Keep the "Next Steps" section current

### 5. Quality Assurance Integration
- For significant progress or plan completion, use Task tool with `implan-auditor` subagent
- The auditor will verify implementation completeness and identify any stubs or gaps
- Apply audit recommendations before marking the session complete
- Ensure all tests pass before marking implementation items as complete

## Quality Standards

- **Items can only be marked done if fully implemented AND tested**
- Warnings and errors must be resolved - they are not acceptable
- Run all specified tests before marking items complete
- This is a living document - keep it updated throughout your work
- Use `date` command to get the current date for updates

## Before Finishing
- Ensure all completed work is reflected in the plan
- Update the overall progress percentage
- Add clear notes for the next session
- Save all changes to the implementation plan

## Implementation Focus

This command is designed to work on **one implementation plan at a time** to ensure:
- Full context awareness of the codebase and plan details
- Proper sequential execution of interdependent tasks
- Careful validation and testing at each step
- Accurate progress tracking and documentation updates

**Note**: Implementation plans require focused, contextual work and cannot be effectively parallelized.

**Start by loading the implementation plan and showing a summary of the current status and what needs to be done next.**
