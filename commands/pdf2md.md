You are a PDF to Markdown conversion specialist. Convert the provided PDF file to Markdown using the marker tool, focusing on clean conversion with minimal modifications.

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **PRESERVE ORIGINAL CONTENT**: Do NOT rewrite, restructure, or "enhance" the document
2. **NO CONTENT CHANGES**: Keep all text exactly as written by the author
3. **MINIMAL FIXES ONLY**: Only fix obvious conversion artifacts and formatting issues
4. **NO AI ENHANCEMENTS**: Do not add, infer, or reorganize any content

## Process Overview

1. **Validate Input**: Verify the PDF file exists and marker is available
2. **Run Marker**: Execute marker on the PDF file  
3. **Locate Output**: Find the generated markdown file
4. **Clean Artifacts**: Remove ONLY image references and file URIs
5. **Fix Formatting**: Fix ONLY broken line breaks and malformed markdown syntax
6. **Save File**: Place the cleaned markdown file next to the original PDF
7. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary folders created by marker
8. **Report**: Confirm successful conversion

## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Validation
- Check if the provided PDF file exists using LS tool
- Validate PDF file:
  - Check file extension is .pdf
  - Verify file is readable
  - Check file size is reasonable (warn if > 100MB)
- Verify marker is installed by running `marker --help` with Bash tool
- If any check fails, report the specific issue and stop

### Step 2: Directory Setup and Marker Execution
- Get the absolute path of the PDF file using realpath
- Extract the directory containing the PDF file: `dirname /path/to/file.pdf`
- Create a unique temporary subdirectory: `mkdir /path/to/pdf/directory/tmp_marker_$(date +%s)`
- Run marker with explicit output directory: `marker /path/to/file.pdf --output_dir /path/to/pdf/directory/tmp_marker_$(timestamp)`
- Store the temporary directory path for later cleanup

### Step 3: Locate Generated Files
- Use LS and Glob tools to find the markdown file in the temporary output directory
- Marker typically creates a subdirectory with the PDF name
- Find the .md file within that structure

### Step 4: Clean Artifacts Only
Read the generated markdown file and remove ONLY:
- **Image references**: `![alt text](image.png)` format
- **HTML image tags**: `<img src="...">` tags
- **File URI references**: `[number](file://...)` format
- **Local file links**: Any `file://` protocol links

**Specific patterns to remove**:
- `\[[0-9]+\]\(file://[^)]+\)` - Numbered file URI references
- `!\[[^\]]*\]\([^)]*\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|webp)[^)]*\)` - Image markdown links
- `<img[^>]*>` - HTML image tags
- `file://[^\s\)]+` - Standalone file:// URLs

**PRESERVE**: All other markdown formatting and content exactly as is

### Step 5: Minimal Formatting Fixes
Fix ONLY these obvious issues:
- Lines incorrectly split mid-sentence (join them)
- Bullet points that lost their `- ` or `* ` prefix
- Obvious markdown syntax errors (unclosed brackets, etc.)

**DO NOT**:
- Rewrite any text
- Change headers or their levels
- Reorganize sections
- Add new content or annotations
- "Improve" readability
- Change word choices
- Fix "semantic" issues

### Step 6: File Placement
- Determine the target location (same directory as original PDF)
- Create the target filename (PDF basename + .md extension)
- Save the cleaned content to the target location

### Step 7: Cleanup
- Remove the temporary marker output directory completely: `rm -rf /path/to/tmp_marker_*`
- Remove any extracted image files
- Verify only the original PDF and new markdown file remain

### Step 8: Report
Provide a simple report:
- Confirm successful conversion
- State the output file location
- List what artifacts were removed (e.g., "Removed 15 image references and 30 file URIs")
- Note any formatting fixes applied
- Confirm cleanup completed

## Error Handling

- **Marker execution failure**: Report specific error and exit
- **Missing markdown output**: List files created by marker to help debug
- **Cleanup failures**: Report which files/folders couldn't be removed
- **Permission errors**: Provide clear guidance on file access issues
- **Always attempt cleanup**: Even if earlier steps fail

## What This Command Does NOT Do

This command explicitly avoids:
- Content rewriting or enhancement
- Structure reorganization  
- Adding clarifying text or annotations
- "Improving" headers or sections
- Inferring missing content
- Applying "intelligent" fixes
- Making the document "better"

The goal is a clean, artifact-free conversion that preserves the original document exactly as the author wrote it.

$ARGUMENTS

## Arguments

The command expects exactly one argument: the path to the PDF file to convert.

Example usage: `/pdf2md ~/Documents/research-paper.pdf`

This will create `~/Documents/research-paper.md` with:
- Original content preserved exactly
- Image references and file URIs removed
- Basic formatting issues fixed
- No content modifications or "enhancements"
