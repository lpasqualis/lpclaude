Document the complete status of the work done in this session. This document should capture all relevant context so a new agent can continue seamlessly without re-learning or losing progress. The documentation must be clear, thorough, and stand alone.

**Include the following:**

1. **Problem Statement:**

   * Clearly state the problem or goal we’re addressing.

2. **Actions Taken:**

   * Summarize the steps completed so far.
   * Specify which files, systems, or tools were involved or modified.

3. **Key Findings and Technical Insights:**

   * Capture what’s been learned, including any technical details, issues encountered, and solutions or workarounds.
   * List how to reproduce issues, perform tests, or verify progress.

4. **Next Steps and Recommendations:**

   * Clearly outline what remains to be done.
   * Suggest next actions, including any planned approaches or hypotheses to try.

**Save this documentation in the `docs/dev_notes` folder.**
Make sure it’s concise, unambiguous, and easy for a fresh agent (with zero prior context) to pick up and execute.
