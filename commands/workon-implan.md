Load and continue work on an implementation plan from the project's `docs/implans/` directory.

## Instructions

1. **Find the implementation plan**:
   - If an implementation name is provided in "$ARGUMENTS", look for a file matching that name
   - If no argument provided:
     - Look for all ACTIVE_*_implan.md files in `docs/implans/`
     - If only one active plan exists, use it
     - If multiple active plans exist, list them and ask the user which one to work on
     - If no active plans exist, inform the user and suggest using `/command create-implan`

2. **Read and analyze the plan**:
   - Read the entire implementation plan document
   - Pay special attention to:
     - The "ðŸ¤– Agent Instructions" section for guidance
     - The "ðŸ“Š Current Status" section to understand progress
     - The "ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps" section for immediate tasks
     - Unchecked [ ] items in the implementation phases

3. **Continue the implementation**:
   - Start with the immediate TODOs listed in "Notes for Next Session"
   - Work on unchecked tasks in the current active phase
   - Follow the validation criteria specified for each task
   - Run tests as specified in the plan before marking items complete

4. **Update the plan as you work**:
   - Mark completed items with [x]
   - Update the "Current Status" section with today's date
   - Add session notes to the "Session History"
   - Document any new learnings or decisions
   - Update progress percentages
   - Keep the "Next Steps" section current

5. **Important reminders**:
   - Items can only be marked done if fully implemented AND tested
   - Warnings and errors must be resolved - they are not acceptable
   - Run all specified tests before marking items complete
   - This is a living document - keep it updated throughout your work
   - Use `date` command to get the current date for updates

6. **Before finishing**:
   - Ensure all completed work is reflected in the plan
   - Update the overall progress percentage
   - Add clear notes for the next session
   - Save all changes to the implementation plan

Start by loading the implementation plan and showing a summary of the current status and what needs to be done next.
