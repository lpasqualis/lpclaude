Analyze our current conversation session to identify the most important learnings and discoveries that should be preserved for future sessions. Extract key insights that were difficult to discover and have a good chance of being needed again when the current context is lost.
Do not capture status of the project, or something very specific and temporary. You need to extract the learnings and insights from the session, the principles behiond the work we did together, and translate these in general terms that can be applied to all situations in the future. This is about leartning to not make the same mistakes, not remembering specific things that will change quickly.

**Focus on capturing:**

1. **Technical Discoveries:**
   * Solutions to complex problems we encountered
   * Non-obvious approaches or workarounds that proved effective
   * Tools, commands, or techniques that were particularly helpful

2. **Configuration & Setup Details:**
   * Important configuration steps or settings
   * Dependencies or prerequisites that weren't immediately obvious
   * Environment-specific requirements we discovered

3. **Gotchas & Pitfalls:**
   * Errors or issues we encountered and how we resolved them
   * Common mistakes to avoid
   * Counterintuitive behaviors we discovered

4. **Project-Specific Insights:**
   * Conventions or patterns unique to this codebase
   * Architectural decisions or constraints we uncovered
   * Integration points or API behaviors worth remembering

5. **Workflow Optimizations:**
   * Efficient approaches we developed during the session
   * Time-saving shortcuts or automation opportunities
   * Testing strategies that proved valuable

**After identifying the learnings:**

Use the memory-keeper agent to store these insights in CLAUDE.md. Ensure each learning is:
- Clear and actionable for future sessions
- Provides sufficient context to be understood independently
- Tagged with today's date for reference
- Organized under appropriate sections in CLAUDE.md
- Checked against existing entries to avoid duplication

Only capture genuinely valuable discoveries that would save significant time or prevent issues in future sessions. Exclude routine operations or information that's easily discoverable through documentation.
