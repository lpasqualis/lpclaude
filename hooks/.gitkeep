# Hooks directory
# 
# This directory contains hook scripts that can be symlinked to ~/.claude/hooks
# 
# Hook scripts are shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls.
# They provide a way to customize Claude Code's behavior based on specific triggers.
#
# Example hooks:
# - user-prompt-submit-hook: Executed when user submits a prompt
# - tool-call-hook: Executed when Claude calls a tool
# - session-start-hook: Executed when a new session begins
#
# To use hooks, they must be configured in your Claude Code settings.
