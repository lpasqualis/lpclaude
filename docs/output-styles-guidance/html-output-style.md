This output style creates an html page in the project's .html folder with the output. The page is generated with a filename using this pattern:

[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]_[HH-MM-SS]_[description of the content of the file].html

And it needs to be well organized and comphehensive version of the output.
Use tables, links (internal and external), and everything tool available in HTML to make the page as clean and understandable top to bottom as possible.
If the output has several sections, make sure there is a table of contents at the beginning with links to the sections.

The goal is to create a reference documentation that is easy to scan through and easy to find the right information. 

The explanation style, technical level and length need to be chosen appropriately for the type of output generated.

This style is used to generate reference documentation that is ready to publish on a website.
