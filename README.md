# Claude Framework Development Workspace

**Supercharge Claude Code with custom agents, commands, and automation that work across ALL your projects.**

Transform Claude Code into your personal AI development assistant by creating custom extensions that automate repetitive tasks, enforce best practices, and streamline your workflow. Write once, use everywhere.

## What Can You Build?

### Custom Agents - Specialized AI Workers
```bash
# Automatically spot security issues in your code
Task(subagent_type="hack-spotter", prompt="Review auth.js")

# Generate comprehensive implementation plans
Task(subagent_type="implan-generator", prompt="Plan user dashboard feature")

# Optimize your documentation
Task(subagent_type="documentation-auditor", prompt="Audit API docs")
```

### Slash Commands - Instant Automation
```bash
# Intelligently commit with semantic versioning
/git:commit-and-push

# Extract and save learnings from your session
/memory:learn

# Create implementation plans from conversations
/implan:create

# Capture session work for handoff
/docs:capture-session
```

### Job Queue System - Never Lose Focus
```bash
# Queue tasks without interrupting your flow
addjob "Refactor the authentication module"
addjob "Update API documentation" 
addjob "Run comprehensive test suite"
addjob "Review and fix linting issues"

# Later, execute all queued jobs in parallel with a single command
/jobs:do

# The system processes up to 10 jobs simultaneously, 
# maintaining context and handling each task independently
```

### Global Directives - Shape Claude's Behavior
- Enforce coding standards across all projects
- Set project-specific conventions
- Define custom workflows and patterns

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Install Framework

```bash
git clone [repository-url] ~/claude-framework
cd ~/claude-framework
./setup.sh
```

That's it! Your custom agents and commands are now available in every project.

### 2. Create Your First Extension (The Smart Way)

**The framework helps you create and optimize its own components!**

**Create a custom command** using the framework's own command creator:
```bash
# Use the framework's command creator - it guides you through everything!
/commands:create

# Follow the interactive prompts to:
# - Choose namespace and name
# - Define requirements
# - Set appropriate tool permissions
# The command creator ensures best practices automatically
```

**Create a custom agent** using Claude's built-in agent creator:
```bash
# Use Claude's built-in agent creation command
/agents

# This will:
# - Guide you through agent definition
# - Create properly formatted YAML frontmatter
# - Set up the agent in the correct location
```

**Optimize automatically** - Just ask Claude!
```bash
# After creating any agent or command, simply say:
"Please optimize my new agent"
# or
"Optimize the command I just created"

# This automatically triggers the framework's optimizers:
# - command-optimizer for commands
# - subagent-optimizer for agents
# They'll ensure best practices, proper structure, and maximum effectiveness
```

**Why this approach is better:**
- âœ… No manual file creation or YAML editing
- âœ… Built-in best practices enforcement
- âœ… Automatic optimization for maximum effectiveness
- âœ… The framework improves itself!

## The Framework That Improves Itself

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Optimizers - Transform Your Extensions

The framework includes sophisticated optimizers that don't just fix issues - they **transform your extensions into high-performance, parallel-capable systems**:

#### Command Optimizer - Makes Commands Lightning Fast
```bash
# After creating any command, just say:
"Please optimize my command"

# The command-optimizer will:
# âš¡ Analyze for parallelization opportunities
# âš¡ Automatically create specialized subagents for parallel execution
# âš¡ Convert sequential operations into concurrent workflows
# âš¡ Set up proper tool permissions and model selection
# âš¡ Transform monolithic commands into efficient, distributed systems

# Example: A command that analyzes 50 files sequentially becomes
# a parallel system processing 10 files simultaneously!
```

#### Subagent Optimizer - Ensures Reliable Invocation
```bash
# After creating any agent, just say:
"Optimize this agent"

# The subagent-optimizer will:
# ðŸŽ¯ Enhance descriptions with trigger keywords for automatic invocation
# ðŸŽ¯ Optimize model selection (haiku for speed, opus for complexity)
# ðŸŽ¯ Validate YAML frontmatter and proactive settings
# ðŸŽ¯ Ensure proper tool permissions are granted
# ðŸŽ¯ Add semantic colors and improve discoverability
```

**The Magic**: These optimizers include "MUST BE USED PROACTIVELY" in their descriptions - they trigger automatically when you mention optimization. They don't just fix problems; they architect solutions that leverage Claude's full parallel processing capabilities!

### Development Workflow

#### ðŸš€ Powerful Job Queue System - Work Without Interruptions
- **`addjob` utility** - Queue tasks for batch processing without breaking your flow
  - Add tasks to a queue while you stay focused on current work
  - Defer complex operations for later execution
  - Create job files that capture full context and requirements
- **`/jobs:do`** - Execute all queued jobs in parallel (up to 10 simultaneously)
  - Process your entire job queue with a single command
  - Automatic parallel execution for maximum efficiency
  - Perfect for end-of-session cleanup, bulk operations, or deferred tasks
- **`/subagents:review-ecosystem`** - Analyze agent interactions

## How It Works

Once installed, the framework uses symlinks to make your extensions globally available:

```
Your ~/.claude/                    This Repository
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/ â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’           agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/ â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’           commands/
â””â”€â”€ directives/ â”€â”€â”€â†’           directives/
```

**Result**: Edit here, use everywhere. Changes take effect instantly.
