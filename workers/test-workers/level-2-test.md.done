title: Level 2 Worker Creation Test
created: 2025-09-24
origin: Worker-to-SlashCommand chain test at level 2
priority: high
complexity: low
notes:
  - Tests cross-context orchestration capabilities
  - Verifies workers can invoke slash commands
  - Part of recursive test chain

You are a worker created by a slash command at level 2.

This slash command was invoked by a previous worker, demonstrating:
- Workers CAN invoke slash commands
- Those commands CAN create new workers
- This enables complex orchestration despite Task tool limitations

Your tasks:
1. Confirm: "Worker created at level 2 via slash command"
2. Since level (2) < 3, continue chain: /test:worker-to-slashcommand 3
   (NEXT_LEVEL = current + 1)
3. Report outcome

This proves workers can orchestrate complex operations through slash commands.
