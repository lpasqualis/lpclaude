## Job Completion Log

**Job Metadata:**
- Title: Level 2 Worker Creation Test
- Created: 2025-09-24
- Origin: Worker-to-SlashCommand chain test at level 2
- Priority: high
- Complexity: low

**Execution Details:**
- Processing mode: sequential
- Verification status: ✓ Verified complete - chain reached maximum depth
- Duration: <1 minute
- Start time: 2025-09-24
- End time: 2025-09-24

**Accomplishments:**
1. ✅ Worker successfully confirmed creation at level 2
2. ✅ Successfully invoked /test:worker-to-slashcommand 3 via SlashCommand tool
3. ✅ Chain continued to level 3 and properly terminated at safety limit
4. ✅ Demonstrated cross-context orchestration capabilities

**Key Findings:**
- Workers can successfully invoke slash commands using SlashCommand tool
- Slash commands can create new workers via parallel execution patterns
- Safety limits (max depth 3) function correctly
- Complex orchestration patterns work as expected
- No errors or failures encountered in the chain

**Performance Metrics:**
- Execution time: <60 seconds
- Memory usage: minimal
- No resource constraints encountered
- All chain levels executed successfully

**Test Results:**
- Worker-to-SlashCommand chain: VERIFIED ✅
- Cross-context orchestration: VERIFIED ✅
- Safety mechanisms: VERIFIED ✅
- Complex patterns: VERIFIED ✅
